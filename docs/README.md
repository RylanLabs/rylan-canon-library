## Purpose

This directory contains the **philosophical and technical canon** extracted from the production fortress.
These documents are the *why* behind every pattern, validator, and template in this library.

Read them. Internalise them. Apply them.

## Integration with Library

- **Patterns** (`../patterns/`): Concrete implementations of these principles
- **Templates** (`../templates/`): Starting points that embed the canon
- **Validators** (`../validators/`): Automated checks for compliance

These documents are **living truth**.
Update only with Trinity consensus.
Never bypass their guidance.

**Trinity Alignment**
Carter authenticates intent.
Bauer verifies adherence.
Beale hardens the foundation.

The fortress demands understanding, not blind obedience.
