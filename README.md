# Rylan Canon Library — Redemption Phase

> Canonical reference — RylanLabs eternal standard (in formation)  
> Status: Experimental — Rebuilding from real experience  
> Date: December 20, 2025

## Purpose

This repository holds the evolving philosophical and structural foundation for RylanLabs discipline.

It is being rebuilt: all code patterns and validators have been removed.

Only proven principles remain. Code patterns will be added only after extraction from real production use.

## Current State

- Philosophy and principles only
- No reusable code libraries
- No validators
- No templates

Real patterns will be earned through manual implementation in actual projects.

## Contents

- `docs/` — Core principles (Seven Pillars, Hellodeolu v6, etc.)
- `RYLANLABS-INSTRUCTION-SET.md` — Personal canon

## Path Forward

1. Build infrastructure projects manually
2. Extract successful patterns
3. Add them here only after production validation
4. Maintain IRL-First: understanding before codification

**The fortress demands discipline earned in fire.**

The Trinity endures.
